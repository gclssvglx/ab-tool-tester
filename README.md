# What is this template for?

We identified the need for a lightweight app that we could use for testing various A/B testing tools. We posit that the app itself will not need to have much with regards to functionaility, indeed it may only need a few pages and HTML elements. The value of the template comes from the suggestion that these elements will be common across all tests and all tools. There is no suggestion that any client-side or server-side tool be treated differently throughout the testing process. On this basis, it would be immensely useful to be able to quickly set up multiple repos with the same base code in order to make comparing the differences between various tools easier. 

# Adding new functionality to the base template

We are largely following the [conventions used on alphagov repos](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/merge-pr.html), that is making branches and having said branches reviewed before being merged into main. Note: You may need to obtain push permission from Graham to be able to push your branch to this repo. 

# How to use this template

Assuming you are not making changes to the base template, you will want to make a new repo based on this template. On GitHub there will be a green 'use this template' button on the main page of this repo. This will allow you to make a new repo in your account based on this template. 

You can use Railway to deploy your app to the internet, details of how to do this can be [found here](https://github.com/gclssvglx/ab-tool-tester/blob/main/doc/hosting-via-railway.md)

# Current A/B testing functionality

We currently do not have a specification for what is needed to test, so we are waiting until our user research is complete before we can list the capabilities of the template here.
